## TOTP Generator

This is a time-based one time password generator.


## Requirements

- Currently only support for MacOS >= 10.12

### Motivation

Many companies nowadays require their employees to use a multi-factor authentication. Like entering a one time password when doing authentication. There are many mobile apps like Google authenticator, but they only work on your phones. What if you want a Desktop version, this is why I built this app.

There might be similar apps out there, but you don't really know if they are safe or not. Are they sending your information to their servers? You don't know. That's another reason I built this application, you can see all the source code here.
